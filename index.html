          <p>
Welcome! I’m Dr. Haradhan Adhikary
Exploring the Building Blocks of the Universe Through Experimental Physics

As a passionate researcher in experimental high-energy nuclear physics, my work seeks to unravel the mysteries of the universe by exploring its most fundamental components. My research delves into the fascinating realms of Quark-Gluon Plasma, critical phenomena in heavy-ion collisions, and neutrino oscillation physics.

Throughout my career, I have been privileged to contribute extensively to the NA61/SHINE collaboration at CERN’s SPS facility in Geneva, Switzerland—one of the most prestigious research centers in the world. My findings have been shared at numerous international conferences and workshops, helping to shape the scientific understanding of nuclear physics.

Beyond my research at CERN, I am an Assistant Professor in the Faculty of Physics at the University of Warsaw. Here, I am honored to mentor and collaborate with the next generation of physicists. My current focus is on neutrino physics, where I am actively involved in groundbreaking experiments with the T2K and Super-Kamiokande (SK) collaborations in Japan, working to shed light on the enigmatic properties of neutrinos and their role in the universe.

Whether analyzing the complex dynamics of heavy-ion collisions or seeking answers to fundamental questions about matter and energy, my work is driven by a deep curiosity and a commitment to advancing scientific discovery.

Connect With Me
I am always eager to engage with fellow researchers, students, and enthusiasts of science. Feel free to explore my work, reach out with questions, or collaborate on exciting new projects. Together, we can push the boundaries of what we know about the universe.
